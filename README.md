#Assignment 3

In this assignment, I first created a new branch.  Next, I added a new question which involved the user guessing a number.  Then I created some code which added up the number of questions the user got correct.  Finding the best method to do this was the most challenging task for me.  Overall, I found this exercise to be very straightforward and simple.

-Today we added a third column to Nicholle's page. We also made it so that her prompts ask questions. The answers the user submits are displayed on the table on the top of her page. It will display green if it is correct and red if it is incorrect. We also added a background color, font family and text color.

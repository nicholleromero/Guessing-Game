#Assignment 3

In this assignment, I first created a new branch.  Next, I added a new question which involved the user guessing a number.  Then I created some code which added up the number of questions the user got correct.  Finding the best method to do this was the most challenging task for me.  Overall, I found this exercise to be very straightforward and simple.
